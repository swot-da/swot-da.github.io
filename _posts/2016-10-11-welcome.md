You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Testing out equations:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi():
  print("hi")
```
